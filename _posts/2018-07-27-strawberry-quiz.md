[Strawberry Studios: 'I am in Love'][stockport.gov.uk] is a temporary exhibition at Stockport Museum that celebrates the 50th birthday of the town's former [recording studio][wikipedia] that revolutionised music recording in the North of England.

For the exhibition, I made a small quiz using pure javascript that sits on an interactive screen. This represents my first foray using javascript.

You can see Blossoms (the band) playing on it [here][blossoms]! If you would like to have a go <a href="{{ site.url }}/StrawberryQuiz/">click here</a>.

N.B. The assets for the quiz are not mine to use freely so the styling is a little sparse!

Code is [here][code].
